<h1>Homework 3. Multithreaded gzip compression filter</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>You're working for a web server house that regularly needs to
generate some fairly large data streams and compress them
using <samp><a href='http://www.gzip.org/'>gzip</a></samp>. The
compression part of this is turning into a CPU bottleneck and the
users are starting to complain. Your company can easily afford to
throw hardware at the problem, so your boss asks you whether you can
reprogram your servers to do the compression in parallel, taking
advantage of the fact that your servers are multiprocessor.</p>

<p>You look into the matter, and discover that there's a C
implementation of a program
called <samp><a href='http://zlib.net/pigz/'>pigz</a></samp> that does
something along the lines that you want. (For convenience, a copy of
a recent version of this program is available on SEASnet in
the <samp>/usr/local/cs/src/pigz</samp> directory, and an executable
is installed in <samp>/usr/local/cs/bin/pigz</samp>.)
The <samp>pigz</samp> program can be used as a filter that reads
programs from standard input and writes to standard
output. Unfortunately, it has a problem: it's written in C. Your
company has standardized on Java, so that it can use just one version
of each executable and run it on a wide variety of servers that you
have: some are x86-64, some are ARM, and some use secret RISC-V-based
hardware whose full nature isn't disclosed even to your group.</p>

<p>You tell this to your boss, who responds, "OK, so do
what <samp>pigz</samp> is doing, but do it in Java". Her suggestion is
to use standard Java classes and see how well your substitute does,
compared to standard <samp>pigz</samp>.</p>

<p>The gzip format lets you
partition an input stream, compress each partition separately, and
concatenate the compressed versions of each partition; the resulting
compressed stream can be decompressed by <samp>pigz</samp>,
by <samp>gzip</samp>, or by any other gzip-format-understanding
program. Unfortunately, this approach doesn't work for your
application, because the data are generated dynamically in
in the form of a stream, and you want the data to be compressed
and delivered to its destination on the fly. You do not want to
generate all the data into a huge file, partition the file,
compress each partition separately, and send the concatenation
of the compressed partitions.</p>

<p>What you want instead, is to do what <samp>pigz</samp> does: divide
the input into fixed-size blocks (with block size equal to 128 KiB),
and have P threads that are each busily compressing a block. That
is, <samp>pigz</samp> starts by reading P blocks and starting a
compression thread on each block. It then waits for the first thread
to finish, outputs its result, and then can reuse that thread to
compress the (P+1)st block.</p>

<p>For better compression, <samp>pigz</samp> does something else.
Instead of compressing each block independently, it uses the last 32
KiB of the previous block to prime the compression dictionary for the
next block. That way, each block other than the first is compressed
better, in the typical case. You want to do that too.</p>

<p>You search around the net some more to see whether someone has done
this, and find that there's a package by C&eacute;drik Lime called
<a href='https://github.com/MessAdmin'>MessAdmin</a> that has a
similar feature in MessAdmin-Core.
It has a lot of code that you don't need, though, and
doesn't have a simple standalone application to try out. You'd like a
stripped down version that just does <samp>pigz</samp>-style
multithreaded compression, so that you compare the two applications'
performances.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Write a Java program called <samp>Pigzj</samp> that behaves like
the C <samp>pigz</samp> implementation, in the sense that it operates
with multiple compression threads to improve wall-clock
performance. Each compression thread acts on an input data block of
size 128 KiB. Each thread uses as its dictionary the last
32 KiB of the previous input data block.
Compressed output blocks are generated in the
same order that their uncompressed blocks were input. The number of
compression threads defaults to the number of available processors,
but this can be overridden. Your program may also use a small, fixed
number of threads to control the compression threads or to do
input/output.</p>

<p>Your implementation can be a simplification of <samp>pigz</samp>,
in the following ways:</p>

<ul>
<li><samp>Pigzj</samp> need not decompress; you have to implement
only the compression part.</li>

<li><samp>Pigzj</samp> needs to support only the
<samp>-p <var>processes</var></samp> options of <samp>pigz</samp>. The
latter option must be spelled with the space between the option and
the value: for example, <samp>-p3</samp> (without a
space) need not be recognized. <samp>Pigzj</samp> can report an
error if any other option syntax is used.</li>

<li><samp>Pigzj</samp> always reads from standard input and writes
to standard output. It can report an error if you specify a file
name.</li>

<li><samp>Pigzj</samp>'s behavior is not specified if the input or
the output is a terminal. For example, it can unconditionally read
standard input and write to standard output without checking whether
these streams are connected to a terminal.</li>

<li>When an error occurs, <samp>Pigzj</samp> need not issue exactly
the same diagnostic message as <samp>pigz</samp>, so long as it
detects and reports the error to standard error, and exits with
nonzero status.</li>

</ul>

<p><samp>Pigzj</samp> should behave like <samp>pigz</samp> in the
following respects:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you decompress the output with <samp>gzip</samp> or
with <samp>pigz</samp>, you get a copy of the input.</li>

<li>The output is compressed, about as well as
<samp>pigz</samp> would compress it.</li>

<li>The output follows the GZIP file format
standard, <a href='https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1952'>Internet RFC
1952</a>.</li>

<li>The output contains just a single member, that is, it does not
contain the concatenation of two or more members. For a definition of
"member" please see RFC 1952 &sect;2.3. If you have trouble
implementing this, then for partial credit you can generate output
with multiple members.</li>

<li>Ideally the output is byte-for-byte identical with the output
of <samp>pigz</samp>. If this is not possible, the reason for any
discrepancies must be documented.</li>

<li><samp>Pigzj</samp> runs faster than <samp>gzip</samp>, when the
number of processors is greater than 1. It is competitive in speed
with <samp>pigz</samp>.</li>

<li>The default value for <samp><var>processes</var></samp> is the
number of available processors; see the Java standard
library's <samp><a href='https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/16/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Runtime.html#availableProcessors()'>availableProcessors</a></samp>
method.</li>

<li>Read errors and write errors are detected. For example, the
command "<samp>pigz &lt;/dev/zero &gt;/dev/full</samp>" reports a
write error and exits with nonzero exit status, and the same should be
true for "<samp>java Pigzj &lt;/dev/zero &gt;/dev/full</samp>".</li>

<li>Out-of-range requests are detected. For example, on the Seasnet
Linux servers "<samp>pigz -p 10000000 &lt;/dev/zero
&gt;/dev/null</samp>" by default reports an error and exits with
nonzero status due to lack of virtual memory,
and <samp>Pigzj</samp> should do likewise.</li>

<li>The input and output need not be a regular file; they may be
pipes.  For example, the command "<samp>cat /etc/passwd | java
Pigzj | cat</samp>" should output the same thing as the command
"<samp>java Pigzj &lt;/etc/passwd</samp>".</li>

</ul>

<p>Measure the performance of three programs:
your <samp>Pigzj</samp>, <samp>/usr/local/cs/bin/pigz</samp>, and
<samp>/usr/local/cs/bin/gzip</samp>. For your measurement platform,
use a Seasnet Linux server, and specify its configuration well enough
so that others outside the class could reproduce your results.
Use shell commands like the following to compare the performance
of the three implementations:</p>

<pre><samp>input=/usr/local/cs/jdk-16.0.1/lib/modules
time gzip &lt;$input &gt;gzip.gz
time pigz &lt;$input &gt;pigz.gz
time java Pigzj &lt;$input &gt;Pigzj.gz
ls -l gzip.gz pigz.gz Pigzj.gz

# This checks Pigzj's output.
pigz -d &lt;Pigzj.gz | <a href='https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cmp.html'>cmp</a> - $input
</samp></pre>

<p>See
what happens if the number of
processors is changed to values other than the default, trying this
with both <samp>pigz</samp> and <samp>Pigzj</samp>. Run each trial
at least three times, and report each instance of real time, user
time, and system time; also, report the compression ratio of each
command.</p>

<p>Use
<a href='https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/strace.1.html'>strace</a>
to generate traces of system calls executed by the three programs, and
compare and contrast the resulting traces. Do they explain the
performance differences that you observe?</p>

<p>Assess your work by writing an after-action report that summarizes
your observations. Focus in particular on any problems
you foresee as the file size and the number of threads scales up, and
which method you expect to work better in general. This report should
be a simple ASCII text file that consumes at most 50,000 bytes.
(Because this report is more substantial than usual, itâ€™s
worth more of the homework than usual.)</p>

<p>Your implementation may use ideas taken from MessAdmin, but
all the code you submit must be your own. If you use ideas, give
MessAdmin's author proper credit for them in your code's comments
and in your after-action report.</p>

<p>Your implementation should operate correctly under OpenJDK 16.
There is no need to run on older Java versions. Please keep
your implementation as simple and short as possible, for the benefit
of the reader. Your program should compile cleanly, without any
warnings.</p>

<p>If your <samp>PATH</samp> is set correctly to a string starting
with "<samp>/usr/local/cs/bin</samp>:", the command
"<samp>java&nbsp;-version</samp>" should output the following
text:</p>

<pre><samp>openjdk version "16.0.1" 2021-04-20
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 16.0.1+9-24)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 16.0.1+9-24, mixed mode, sharing)
</samp></pre>

<p>the command "<samp>pigz&nbsp;--version</samp>" should output
"<samp>pigz 2.6</samp>", and the command
"<samp>gzip&nbsp;--version</samp>" should output "<samp>gzip
1.10</samp>" followed by some licensing information.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>To turn in your assignment, submit a single jar file
<samp>hw3.jar</samp> that contains both your Java source code and
a plain text file <samp>README.txt</samp> that holds your
assessment. Do not submit class files.
Before submitting <samp>hw3.jar</samp> you should test it using
the following shell commands on SEASnet:</p>

<pre><samp># Make a fresh directory and change into it.
<a href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/mkdir.html'>mkdir</a> testdir
<a href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cd.html'>cd</a> testdir

# Extract your program.
jar xf ../hw3.jar

# Make sure you have a README.txt file.
<a href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/ls.html'>ls</a> -l README.txt

# Build your modified version.
javac $(<a href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/find.html'>find</a> . -name '*.java')

# Check your modified version; the output should be empty.
cat ../hw3.jar | java Pigzj | pigz -d | cmp - ../hw3.jar
</samp></pre>
