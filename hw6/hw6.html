<h1>Homework 6. Evaluate a language for secure camera-based HVAC control</h1>

<p><small>[<a href='../index.html'>131 home</a> &gt; <a href='../homework.html'>Homework</a>]</small></p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>You’re working for a company Haversack Inc. that
  designs, build and installs heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
  (HVAC) systems for large customers.
  Haversack has a team working on SecureHEAT, a system intended to save
  money by controlling temperature more efficiently in buildings.
  Instead of using traditional building thermostats, SecureHEAT
  uses inexpensive cameras to implement a so-called Human
  Embodied Autonomous Thermostat (HEAT) system that monitors the faces
  of human occupants, calculates the occupants’ facial temperatures,
  and uses these calculations to control the buildings’ air
  temperatures. The cameras are attached to building power, and have
  no battery backup; they use a wireless network to connect to base
  stations at secure locations within the building. As the cameras’
  embedded CPUs have limited processing power and memory, the base
  stations do the bulk of the calculations and use the results to
  control the building’s HVAC units.</p>

</ul>

<p>A problem has come up when trying to market the HEAT system: many
  of your potential customers manage buildings that house banks, the
  military, intelligence services, prisons, or other organizations
  that require high security. These customers are concerned that
  software in the cameras will be penetrated, and will leak
  information to adversaries. Although Haversack has used a mixture of C
  and C++ to program such systems in the past, your customers have
  heard that C and C++ programs are vulnerable to these sorts of
  attacks. In order to address these concerns, your boss wants your
  team to
  investigate alternative programming languages that support the following
  properties well:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The software running inside the cameras must be cleanly written
    and easy to audit.</li>
  <li>The software should be
    a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standalone_program'>freestanding
      program</a>, with no separate operating system (as the OS itself
      would be a source of security holes).</li>
  <li>The software running should be as simple and stripped-down as
    possible. This rules out using higher-level languages like Python
    or Java, which assume components like interpreters or garbage
    collectors that your potential customers might not trust.</li>
  <li>The software must be capable of interfacing to low-level
    hardware devices, such as camera or network interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your boss suggests that your team evaluate alternative
  programming languages as candidates for this application.
  Your boss is not expecting working prototypes for the proposed
  application, just a feasibility study of the languages.</p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Consider the following three languages.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href='https://odin-lang.org/'>Odin</a></li>
  <li><a href='https://vlang.io/'>V</a></li>
  <li><a href='https://ziglang.org/'>Zig</a></li>
</ol>

<p>If your student-ID is the 9 digit integer S, choose the language
  numbered (S % 3) + 1 from the above list, where % denotes the
  integer remainder operator. For example, if your student ID is
  220-296-859, choose the language Odin because (220296859 % 3) + 1
  equals 2.</p>

<p>Do some research on the chosen language and its support software as
a potential platform. Your research should include an examination of the
language and system documentation to help determine whether it would
be effective. We want to know whether the language supports the proposed
application well.
</p>

<p>Evaluate the features of the proposed language.
  What strengths and weaknesses do you see?
  What are the biggest problems you anticipate when using it
  for this application?</p>

<p>Write an executive summary that gives the language’s
  strengths and weaknesses, along with
  problems for this application. Your summary should focus on the
  technology’s effects on security, ease of use, flexibility, generality,
  performance, and reliability; thie idea is to explore the most-important
  language-relevant technical challenges in doing the proposed
  app.</p>

<p>The summary should be suitable for Haversack’s software executives,
  that is, for readers who have some expertise in software, and who
  know C and C++ reasonably well, along with all the languages
  already covered in this class.</p>

<p>The summary should be in 10-point font or larger and should be at
  most two pages. You can put references and appendixes in later
  pages, if you can’t get under the page limit: the appendixes can
  contain any source code or diagrams that don’t otherwise fit. Please keep
  the <a href='../comm.html'>resources for written reports and oral
  presentations</a> in mind, particularly its rubrics and its advice
  for citations to sources that you consulted.</p>

<p>In your evaluation, do not worry about whether the SecureHEAT
  team already knows the language or its infrastructure;
  you can assume that they’ll come up to speed quickly.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this assignment,
  assume the latest stable version of the language;
  you need not worry about portability to earlier versions.
  Specify the version number in your summary.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>Submit a file <samp>hw6.pdf</samp> containing your summary.</p>
